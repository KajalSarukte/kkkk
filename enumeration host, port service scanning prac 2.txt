2. Enumeration host,port,service scanning

1. Launch Kali Linux 
2. Select Application > Information Gathering > Nmap, as shown in the figure.

$ sudo su
nmap -sP 192.198.5.0/24
nmap -sS 192.168.10.1    
nmap -sSV -O 198.168.1.1 -oN enum.txt
#after that open the enum.txt file from home
cat enum.txt
nmap -sSV 192.168.2.1 -oN Enumeration.txt
cat Enumeration.txt
#after that open the enum.txt file from home

Then 'Nmap' will scan all the nodes on the given network range and display all the hosts that 
are running, as shown in figure.
4. Type "nmap-sS <IP address of the target machine>", and press Enter, as shown in figure 
(here we used 192.xx.xx.xx as the IP address)
Then a Stealthy syn scan will be initiated, and all the open ports that are running on the 
machine will be displayed, as shown in figure.
Now we can see all the open ports along with the services.
We will find version of each of these services running on the open port by performing a syn 
with version detection switch.
5. Type "nmap -sSV -O <IP address of the target machine>", and press Enter, 
Now, the Nmap performs the scan and displays the versions of the services, 
We have found the enumerated result. We will now save the scan result.
6. Type "nmap sSV -O <IP address of the target machine> oN Enumeration.txt", and press 
Enter, as shown in figure.
Nmap will now perform Stealthy Scan with version and OS detection, and save the result in a 
text file (Enumeration.txt) , which will be located on home (root) directory
7. Click on Places > Home Folder
8. Double click on the file Enumeration.txt, as shown in fi
Then the following window will appear, as shown in figure.
You can also check the scanning result in the command line terminal.
Type "cat Enumeration.txt", and press Enter, as shown in figure.
Then the output of the scanning process will be shown in the command line terminal, as 
shown in figure.
